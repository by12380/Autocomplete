# Autocomplete

Autocomplete is a highly performant, scalable, and available service for providing an application with search word suggestions based on the frequency of past search queries similar to Google seearch.

An additional goal of this project is to create an autocomplete service that is portable and reusable, decoupled from the rest of the system.

However, to demonstrate it's use case, this repo contains the rest of the components that will represent a full system using Autocomplete.
